Things I am thinking about:

Other non-editables
* I want things that they can interact with 

- fidget spinner
    - have to figure out how to use arc function
- car?     
    - have axle shape already built in and rectangular top for them to draw side profile
- As a further exploration of box, mug/cup?
    - hygenic worry, just design handle?


Note on Box/Square:
- Maybe allow them to put in inside dimension? Then I can populate board with non editable anchors

Things to keep in mind
- ensuring closure
    - making sure that each endpoint is being used as part of two line segments
- when moving to more complicated 3D patterns, keeping in mind which angle they are designing from


TO DO
- numpy arrays
- event.pos()
